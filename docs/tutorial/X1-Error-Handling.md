# Error Handling

In case of server-input in an unexpected format, we get quite weird error messages.
This lecture shows, how Exceptions/Errors can be handled.

## Instructions

1. Damage the Bot, e.g. set the server-input for parsing to "" and check what happens in the arena.
   Check both the board and the server logs.
2. Work through the worksheets
    - [exceptions](../../src/main/worksheets/X1_01-exceptions.sc)
    - [Try](../../src/main/worksheets/X1_02-Try.sc)
